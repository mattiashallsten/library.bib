  title =	 "The Choreography of Gender in Traditional Vietnamese Music",
  abstract =	 "This Ph.D. project in artistic research is concerned with the
                  function of gesture in traditional Vietnamese music. Building
                  on gender analysis of musical performance in TV shows, and
                  further on autoethnographic inquiry throughout the artistic
                  projects, the artistic output articulates a critical
                  understanding of these practices. The aims of the project are
                  to investigate the social function and meaning of musical
                  gesture in traditional Vietnamese music, and to develop
                  artistic responses that articulate an individual voice. The
                  research questions that emerge from these conceptual and
                  artistic aims are: 1. What gender conventions can gesture
                  analysis of musical performance unveil? 2. In what ways can
                  music created through the choreographic structuring of
                  movement reveal and question gender conventions in musical
                  performance?3. How can my performance, in intercultural and
                  interdisciplinary artistic collaborations, challenge current
                  gender norms and instigate change in practices of traditional
                  Vietnamese music?  The method and design of this Ph.D. project
                  builds on qualitative analysis of gesture in musical
                  performance, with particular emphasis on employing a gender
                  perspective in this analysis. In the artistic work, analysis
                  of gesture has constituted a point of departure for the
                  creation of a series of intermedia works that seek to develop
                  methods that combine the practices of choreography and musical
                  composition. Intercultural collaboration has provided
                  particular challenges and possibilities in the development of
                  each of these works. The results of the artistic work are
                  published online in The Research Catalogue.The outcomes of the
                  project outline how gendered gesture is taught in higher music
                  education in Vietnam, and taken together with the historical
                  overview of how nationalism and communism has shaped the
                  country, that this teaching has an immediate relation to
                  nation branding. The teaching of traditional music is equally
                  related to the commercialised views of women as it is grounded
                  in the preservation of tradition. Further, the development of
                  a practice of composing music using gestural-sonorous objects
                  as material became the central artistic method throughout this
                  Ph.D. project. It has offered novel possibilities of
                  approaching gestural materials and creating new choreographies
                  and music based on a critical approach to the image of women
                  in popular media. The results finally suggest that
                  intercultural and inter- disciplinary artistic practice can
                  propose social change, and provide counter images of
                  traditionally gendered behaviour.",

 abstract = {The discourse on the music of the first wave of post-war international Japanese composers (Takemitsu, Ishii, Mayuzumi) has centered around the interculturality of "East and West," i.e. the congruence of Japanese heritage with the skilled absorption of European classical compositional craft. An inquiry into the very nature of the heritage defined according to the ways by which composers, both Japanese and non-Japanese, rediscovered, reconstructed, and above all reinvented "Japanese" heritage has largely been absent from this discourse. Here, I apply the critical framework of "world music history"—a musicological sub-discipline that has been developed in recent years for the purpose of re-interpreting individual music production and reception as globally-entangled episodes—in order to probe into processes of re-invention against the backdrop of a post-war global search for cultural alternatives to the European avant-garde. One of the key figures in this process was John Cage, whose aestheticization of "Eastern" philosophies urged Japanese composers of the post-war generation to recontextualize a broad range of Japan-derived craft, from ma (silence) to gagaku ensemble writing. As a result, their music would become both avant-garde and different from that of their predecessors. I shall examine Cage's first visit to Japan in 1962 against the case study of the East-West Music Encounters in 1961, an extravaganza music festival which in many ways contributed to the construction of the "non-West" as something static, timeless, and ahistorical; thus, incompatible with the West. Critical inquiries into these two cases reveal that in the post-war global era the "culture" of "intercultural" should be subjected to reinterpretation, redefinition, and recontextualization.},

What will be the role of technology in music at the end of the 21st century? Who will listen and play this music? What will be the role of the body in the creation, interpretation and perception of music? These are some of the issues that the composer addresses through an account of her extensive career. Oliveros witnessed and participated actively in the important transformation of the history of music with the development of electricity throughout the 20th century, and, in this paper, she reflects on and problematizes the possible transcendental changes that the advance of digital technology will bring in the current era.},

	abstract = {Everyday listening is the experience of hearing events in the world rather than sounds per se. In this article, I explore the acoustic basis of everyday listening as a start toward understanding how sounds near the ear can indicate remote physical events. Information for sound-producing events and their dimensions is investigated using physical analyses of events to inform acoustic analyses of the sounds they produce. The result is a variety of algorithms which enable the synthesis of sounds made by basic-level events such as impacts, scraping, and dripping, as well as by more complex events such as bouncing, breaking, spilling, and machinery. These algorithms may serve as instantiated hypotheses about the acoustic information for events. Analysis and synthesis work together in their development: Just as analyses of the physics and acoustics of sound-producing events may inform synthesis, so listening to the results of synthesis may inform analysis. This raises several issues concerning evaluation, specification, and the tension between formal and informal physical analyses. In the end, however, the fundamental test of these algorithms is in the sounds they produce: I describe them in enough detail here that readers may implement, test, and extend them. © 1993, Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.

The author suggests that natural vision depends on the eyes in the head on a body supported by the ground, the brain being only the central organ of a complete visual system. When no constraints are put on the visual system, people look around, walk up to something interesting and move around it so as to see it from all sides, and go from one vista to another.

	abstract = {Many years of working with electroacoustic music evoke the question in what sense one can talk about life in music. The question does not concern traces of the composer's life in the work, vivifying performances or musical experiences full of life, but rather the life of music itself.In order to find an answer to the question I examine three solo concertos in the light of the philosophy of Deleuze and Guattari. The concertos, for flute, violin and piano respectively, with chamber ensemble, were composed within the frame of the dissertation and emanate from the ritornello form as found in Vivaldi. The ritornello concept is also present in Deleuze and Guattari, especially in the book A Thousand Plateaus, in which it serves as a collector and transformer of forces and connections that affect its surroundings. With the ritornello as a bridge between this philosophy and the music, I undertake a close reading of the three solo concertos with the philosophy as a companion.With the ritornello and other related concepts in Deleuze and Guattari, such as assemblage, chaos, territorializing and deterritorializing, I force my way past the musical structure in order to uncover the creational forces of music. In the flute and the flute concerto it is about establishing a fragile point in chaos; in the violin and the violin concerto all is centred around the ground, the earth and the territory; and in the piano and the piano concerto it is a matter of a single drawn-out leave-taking. These three moments -- entrance, deepening and dissolution -- simultaneously operate at a large number of levels, and together they form a single large ritornello of musical life.Contemplating music and musical instruments through the ritornello gives several new perspectives on the music and the composing, among them a view of instruments as upholders of different aspects of the ritornello, the composer as a preserver of the creational forces of music, and the musical structure as a network of forces and connections.},

	url = {http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&btnG=Search&q=intitle:Compact+Spherical+Loudspeaker+Array+for+Variable+Sound-Radiation#0},
	abstract = {In this work a new spherical loudspeaker array is developed that allows variable sound- radiation in all directions, so called spherical beamforming. In addition to the realization of musical and artistic performances, it can be used for room-acoustical measurements. From a mathematical point of view, radiating sound fields can be decomposed into spherical harmonics, which can be played back by the loudspeaker array and hereby reproduce the desired sound field. The few existing spherical loudspeaker arrays in this field of application use a regular design with Platonic solids, which on the one hand show convenient behav- ior due to their mathematical decomposition, but on the other hand use an inefficiently large number of loudspeakers. In contrast to Platonic solids, this work uses a spherical geometry, which allows irregular arrangements in favor of an optimal arrangement of the loudspeakers. The spherical cabinet developed in this work mounts 16 loudspeakers, which are uniformly distributed over the surface. This arrangement provides controlled playback of the spherical harmonics up to the third order. As the array is designed for mid-frequency range, small dimensions of the sphere and loudspeakers are desirable. Therefore a com- promise between compact dimensions and upper and lower cut-off frequencies must be achieved. In parti- cular spatial aliasing should be avoided and a feasible dynamic range shall be enforced by appropiate filtering.
The work starts with the design and construction of the spherical loudspeaker array including amplification, wiring and mounting. Simulations using the so called sphere cap model, which models the distribution of the loudspeakers on the sphere analytically, enable a pre-estimation of the radiation properties. Finally, acoustical measurements with the complete prototype of the array are made to determine the transfer properties of the loudspeakers and their mutual interaction in the all-over system. For system control, an appropriate algorithm using this data is implemented. This control system contains angular and radial filters. As the latter can use unfeasibly high bass-boosts, an appropriate filterbank for limitation is developed.},

This has been best characterized for those aspects of music that involve pitch. Pitch sequences are heard in terms of relative, as well as absolute, pitch. Pitch combinations give rise to emergent properties not present in the component notes. In this review we discuss the basic auditory mechanisms contributing to these and other perceptual effects in music.},

Language: English{\textbackslash}nDescribes a method of algorithmic composition that generates progressions of nonharmonic sonorities, which can be defined as simultaneities of pure-tone components in arbitrary frequency relationships. A computer-based model of Terhardt's 1972 theory of pitch perception predicts the relative perceptual importances of all pitches evoked by a sonority, the sensory consonance of a sonority, and the strength of harmonic and melodic relationships as perceived between successive sonorities. The model may be incorporated into compositional algorithms that control variations in sensory consonance and tonal relationships. Abstract Source: author},

In addition, some more classical, instruments survive as grave goods in China. In addition, the free-reed mouth-organ is often represented in mural art in Burma and Thailand.

	abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

It is shown here that the structure of the Euclidean algorithm may be used to automatically generate, very efﬁciently, a large family of rhythms used as timelines (rhythmic ostinatos), in traditional world music. These rhythms, here dubbed Euclidean rhythms, have the property that their onset patterns are distributed as evenly as possible in a mathematically precise sense, and optimal manner. Euclidean rhythms are closely related to the family of Aksak rhythms studied by ethnomusicologists, and occur in a wide variety of other disciplines as well. For example they characterize algorithms for drawing digital straight lines in computer graphics, as well as algorithms for calculating leap years in calendar design. Euclidean rhythms also ﬁnd application in nuclear physics accelerators and in computer science, and are closely related to several families of words and sequences of interest in the study of the combinatorics of words, such as mechanical words, Sturmian words, two-distance sequences, and Euclidean strings, to which the Euclidean rhythms are compared.},

I had for some time wanted to make a work for Javanese gamelan but was hesitant to do so for three reasons: one, I didn’t want to infringe on the generosity of my colleagues Sumarsam and I. M. Harjito, who were so often asked to relinquish important rehearsal time for the performance of new works; two, I have always been wary of using someone else’s music in my own work; and three, I didn’t have an original idea. I certainly didn’t want my piece to sound Indonesian. It wasn’t until I started imagining the bowl-shaped bonangs of the gamelan orchestra more as resonant chambers to be sounded than objects to be struck, that I felt I could make a work that I could call my own. I now felt comfortable in asking my colleagues if they would be interested in having me compose a work for their ensemble. They agreed.

During the performance four players place bonangs of various sizes over microphones, creating feedback, the pitch of which is determined by the shape and size of the bowl and the resonant characteristics of the room. Three gender players strike the bars on their metallaphones, searching for the pitches of the feedback strands. Since it is virtually impossible that a strand of feedback will match exactly a pitch on any fixed-pitch instruments, audible beats – bumps of sound which occur as sound waves coincide – occur. The closer the tuning, the slower the beating. When the players reach near-unison with a feedback strand they slow down or speed up their playing, creating beating patterns between the pitches of their instruments and those of the feedback. Music for Gamelan Instruments, Microphones, Amplifiers and Loudspeakers was first performed on October 18, 1994, World Music Hall, Wesleyan University by the Wesleyan University Gamelan Ensemble.},

In my artistic project I investigated how new knowledge in these fields could work as a musical resource and inspire to new solo music for double bass.
My method has been to compose studies, to make use of this new knowledge in a musical setting. In the etudes I have isolated small areas such as; beating, multiphonics, overpressure, just intonation intervals, the pitch-rhythm continuum, difference tones and microtonal modulation.
This work has changed my view of the concept tone, interval and consonance/dissonance. Working this way has triggered a lot of inspiration and productivity for new unexpected music. This text could be useful for double bass or string players, composers for double bass, musicians that want inspiration in solo playing or incorporate Just Intonation in their musical language.},

To address this, fifteen recorded classic blues performances by acknowledged early masters of the blues were studied. Computer based methods were used to collect the audio frequencies of note samples from each performance. Each note had its frequency ratio with respect to the average tonic tone for the performance converted to microtonal cents format. Cluster analysis was performed on these note collections to identify individual note clusters. The fourth and fifth were clearly identified. Three principal "blue note" clusters were isolated with means of 319.1, 582.8, and 1037.9 cents. These values corresponded closely to the harmonic half diminished seventh chord (i.e. 1, b3, b5, b7 with harmonics 5:6:7:9). The "neutral" third was confirmed to occur in this sample. A similar blending of the perfect fourth and tritone was demonstrated in this study. The flat 7th presented as three separate clusters. Several clusters idiosyncratic to individual performers were also identified. Findings are discussed with regards to the array of theories proposed to explain the blues.},

	abstract = {Musical pitch perception is argued to result from nonmusical biological constraints and thus to have similar characteristics across cultures, but its universality remains unclear. We probed pitch representations in residents of the Bolivian Amazon—the Tsimane’, who live in relative isolation from Western culture—as well as US musicians and non-musicians. Participants sang back tone sequences presented in different frequency ranges. Sung responses of Amazonian and US participants approximately replicated heard intervals on a logarithmic scale, even for tones outside the singing range. Moreover, Amazonian and US reproductions both deteriorated for high-frequency tones even though they were fully audible. But whereas US participants tended to reproduce notes an integer number of octaves above or below the heard tones, Amazonians did not, ignoring the note ‘‘chroma’’ (C, D, etc.). Chroma matching in US participants was more pronounced in US musicians than non-musicians, was not affected by feedback, and was correlated with similarity-based measures of octave equivalence as well as the ability to match the absolute f0 of a stimulus in the singing range. The results suggest the cross-cultural presence of logarithmic scales for pitch, and biological constraints on the limits of pitch, but indicate that octave equivalence may be culturally contingent, plausibly dependent on pitch representations that develop from experience with particular musical systems.},

	abstract = {Simultaneous consonance is a salient perceptual phenomenon corresponding to the perceived pleasantness of simultaneously sounding musical tones. Various competing theories of consonance have been proposed over the centuries, but recently a consensus has developed that simultaneous consonance is primarily driven by harmonicity perception. Here we question this view, substantiating our argument by critically reviewing historic consonance research from a broad variety of disciplines, re-analyzing consonance perception data from four previous behavioral studies representing more than 500 participants, and modeling three Western musical corpora representing more than 100,000 compositions. We conclude that simultaneous consonance is a composite phenomenon that derives in large part from three phenomena: interference, periodicity/harmonicity, and cultural familiarity. We formalize this conclusion with a computational model that predicts a musical chord’s simultaneous consonance from these three features, and release this model in an open-source R package, incon, alongside 15 other computational models also evaluated in this paper. We hope that this package will facilitate further psychological and musicological research into simultaneous consonance.},

This problem can be handled by upscaling B-format signals using several methods both in the time and frequency domain. In this paper, a novel Sequential Multi Stage DNN (SMS-DNN) is developed for upscaling Ambisonic signals. The SMS-DNN allows for training of a very large number of layers since training is performed in blocks consisting of a ﬁxed number of layers. Additionally, the vanishing gradient problem in DNN with a large number of layers is also effectively handled by the proposed SMS-DNN due to its sequential nature. This method does not require prior estimation of the source locations and works in multiple source scenarios. Reconstructed sound ﬁeld analysis, subjective and objective evaluations conducted on the upscaled Ambisonic sound scenes indicate reasonable improvements when compared to the benchmark HOA reproduction.},

	abstract = {This paper represents the first attempt to trace the historical development of the double-reed pipe melodies in togaku, a musical repertory imported into Japan from China between the seventh and the ninth centuries and performed to this day. In this study I analyze the double-reed pipe melody in each historical period , and by comparing it with the development of the transverse flute, which plays similar melodies to those of the double-reed pipe today I shed light on the differences in melodic development between the double-reed pipe and transverse flute.},
